<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug: using a <video> tag without specifying a source.</p><code><video controls><source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></code><p>The issue is that there is no fallback if the browser doesn't support the provided video format, or if there is an issue loading the video. A better approach is to always provide fallback content and multiple sources for better compatibility.</p>
